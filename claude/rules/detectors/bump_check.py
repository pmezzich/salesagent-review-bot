"""bump-check — one command to run every harness freshness detector + its self-test.

Run on every `adcp` version bump (and after any error-code / ERROR_CODE_MAPPING / schema change).
The harness embeds two version-pinned spec snapshots (recovery_audit's CODE_RECOVERY table and
sdk_spec_drift's error-code enum); when the SDK pin moves they go stale silently unless something
checks. This is that check.

Two signals are ACTIONABLE (they mean the harness itself is broken or out of date):
  • a detector SELF-TEST fails  → the detector's own logic is broken; fix before trusting anything.
  • a STALE-SNAPSHOT warning     → the SDK pin moved past a snapshot; re-fetch it (each file's
                                    docstring carries the exact refresh command).

Everything else the detectors print (recovery divergences, forced codes, FIXME markers) is a
STANDING count — compare it to your known baseline; a change is worth investigating, but it is
not a per-run alarm (these are pre-existing, adjudicated items).

Usage: uv run python .claude/rules/private/detectors/bump_check.py
Exit: 2 = a self-test failed · 1 = a snapshot is stale · 0 = self-tests pass and snapshots fresh.
